# oh-story

A web novel writing skill pack with built-in adapters for Claude Code, OpenCode, ZCode, OpenClaw, Codex CLI, Reasonix, and workbuddy. Web AI / agent environments that can read project files can use the generic skills path. Covers the full pipeline for long-form and short-form Chinese web novels: trend scanning, deconstruction, writing, AI tone removal, and cover generation.

> **Independent repository and release line:** This is the active, independently operated product repository and release line for oh-story. It is not part of GitHub's fork network and does not automatically sync from any external repository. Future features, versions, Dev/Release channels, and commercial development are planned and maintained independently. Its early code evolved from MIT-licensed open-source work; the complete Git history preserves source and contribution attribution, and [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) governs distribution and use.
>
> This README documents only this repository's capabilities and its own examples, without importing third-party demo projects. The original enhancements come from end-to-end writing practice on [财阀除名那晚，古井给我递了药方](https://fanqienovel.com/page/7661645008545516606) and multiple Fanqie short stories.

### Independently developed upgrades (distilled from real writing practice)

- **Typo pre-gate**: new `check-typos.js` runs as the very first check after each chapter is saved (ahead of AI-tone/degeneration/punctuation scripts) — born from a real miss caught by a reader; curated high-confidence dictionary, advisory-only, never rewrites.
- **Field-validated genre packs**: new `现实共鸣型` (family-of-origin exploitation / workplace-gaslighting counterattack / bride-price traps) and `悬疑脑洞型` (death games / rule-horror, with a five-step authoring method and the true-rules doctrine) — coverage gaps identified by cross-checking the real 番茄 writer-dashboard hot-story board against two independent hit-story corpora, then used in actual finished stories.
- **Reversal rule disambiguated**: "one reversal per story" rewritten as "one spine-level reversal, high-frequency minor flips as pacing fuel", calibrated against real hit-story corpora (~one minor flip per 800-1500 chars).
- **Phase 5 QA steps are now mandatory**: the consistency-checker and independent AI-tone review used to be worded as "spawn if deployed", which let them get silently skipped across several chapters in a row. Now hard-required.
- **Per-chapter QA progress table**: new `追踪/质检进度.md` makes it mechanically checkable whether each QA sub-step actually ran, instead of scrolling through prose logs.
- **Dynamic foreshadow status-column detection**: `detect-story-gaps.sh` no longer hardcodes a column index — it locates the "status" column from the header row at runtime, fixing false positives across three different real-world table layouts (protocol template, an actual project, and the test fixture).
- **Deterministic dialogue-density stat**: `check-ai-patterns.js` now emits an info-level dialogue-density figure instead of requiring a hand-written script every time.
- **Solo-scene dialogue techniques**: `dialogue-mastery.md` documents two reusable patterns (phone-call-as-dialogue, self-talk-to-object) for chapters with only one character on stage.
- **Dual-POV hook phrasing guardrail**: the outline template now warns that "he/she doesn't know that..." hook phrasing can't be copied verbatim into prose without tripping the anti-AI-tone hard rule.
- **Pre-publish plain-text export**: new `export-for-platform.js` does title/body extraction for copy-paste only — no login, no submission, no credential handling.

## Core Approach

> **Tropes = deterministic emotional payoff**

Professional authors follow a three-step method:

1. **Scan** — analyze trending charts, identify genres, characters, and entry points.
2. **Deconstruct** — break down pacing and plot materials, build a personal module library.
3. **Commercialize** — learn and apply hooks, payoff density, expectation management.

Built around four pillars: reverse-engineering hits · plot modularization · layered state management · human-AI collaboration.

> Starting in v0.7.10: fixes Chinese novels unexpectedly switching into English mid-draft with a three-layer language gate. Chinese long/short-form generation is locked to `zh`; the pre-delivery deep scan blocks full English sentences/paragraphs, English runs, and stray lowercase English tokens while protecting URLs, email, code, paths, and model identifiers and honoring exact `.deslop-whitelist` entries; post-write hooks scan the saved prose, and the long-form preflight blocks the next chapter while the previous chapter still carries English-language debt. Blocking findings must be repaired and rescanned. `agents_version` is now 29; redeploy with `/story-setup` and start a new session.
>
> Starting in v0.7.9: this fork begins shipping verified fixes for known gaps that upstream has not implemented. New deployments fail closed when Claude attempts ordinary long-form writing without tracking state, while legacy deployments and the controlled `story-import` migration window for an existing analysis library remain compatible; new chapter-extractor tasks prefer strict JSON validation plus deterministic Markdown rendering; the prose detector adds an advisory for sensory objects used as perceiving subjects; and all long/short chart scrapers reuse one run clock while exposing both the UTC capture instant and the local filename date. `agents_version` is now 28; redeploy with `/story-setup` and start a new session.
>
> Starting in v0.7.8: selectively ports the upstream 3174916 / fcec86e increments without replacing this repository's custom safeguards. The outline-before-prose guard now covers Bash redirection and `tee/touch/cp/mv/install`, book discovery is bounded to four levels with symlink-escape protection, Qimao gains daily/monthly periods, and Qidian gains word-count/recommendation/signing/pricing fields. Stage 6 reuses `_progress.md` chapter boundaries, batch review persists unresolved findings, chapter-extractor gains pre-output format constraints, and 500+ chapter works use 10-20 chapter sub-agent batches with reduced-result merging. The prose gate also closes the loop on unnecessary quote emphasis around ordinary nouns. `agents_version` is now 27; redeploy with `/story-setup` and start a new session.
>
> Starting in v0.7.7: selectively ports the upstream instruction cleanup without replacing this repository's custom guards. `story-deslop` drops the fixed “1-3 sentences per paragraph” rule that encouraged telegraphic prose, varies paragraph density by beat, and restores sentence-level rhythm guidance. The `narrative-writer` and shared anti-AI references are deduplicated while preserving the local emotion floor, typo, planning-marker leakage, retention, and continuity checks. Long-form setup Phases 1-3 move to an on-demand reference so daily chapter writing no longer loads the full topic/setting/outline workflow. `agents_version` is now 26; redeploy with `/story-setup` and start a new session.
>
> Starting in v0.7.3: fixes the cross-CLI fallback path for chapter analysis. ZCode / OpenClaw / Reasonix / generic Web AI never deploy project agents, so Stage 2 always falls back to serial processing — yet the fallback instructions pointed at a `chapter-extractor.md` those four adapters cannot read, a circular dependency. It now points at `output-templates.md`, which ships inside the skill itself. Chapter summaries become narrative rather than causal-chain lists, source quotes are curated instead of exhaustive, and a mechanical check enforces the plain-description field on every plot point. The Dashboard tree now loads on demand and correctly recognizes standard short-story projects (single-file `正文.md` layout); writing projects and analysis libraries no longer share one scan budget. Also fixes the update check, which never worked: the old repository name made the GitHub API return 301 and `curl -fsS` did not follow redirects. `agents_version` 21 → 22, so **existing projects must rerun `/story-setup` and start a new session**.
>
> Starting in v0.7.2: prose defaults return to natural comma-linked sentences instead of rewarding telegraphic fragments; outlines specify events and constraints without forcing prose to mirror the outline's shape; chapter endings land on a concrete action, image, or line of dialogue, with a new summary-trailer detector. Chapters still follow “pay one off, change one state, open one next step,” while hard twists and cliffhangers are reserved for structural nodes. `/story dashboard` adds a local workspace whose tests use neutral generated fixtures rather than third-party demos. Existing projects should rerun `/story-setup` and start a new session.
>
> Starting in v0.7.0: two more runtimes — native ZCode 3.3.4 (install the repo as a marketplace/plugin, `story-setup target_cli=zcode`) and Reasonix Phase 1 (skills + native plugin manifest); hook cores unified onto a shared node core with a six-runtime parity lock; long-form unifies the five old names (plot-strand / loop-card / …) into "剧情单元" (plot unit) and feeds decomposition output into volume/chapter outlines; the anti-AI-tone gate is now mechanized — the post-write prose net auto-scans deterministic toxic phrasings, and a "toxic-phrase debt gate" blocks the next chapter until the previous one is cleared (stateless, node-missing fails open, opt out explicitly with `<!-- 去味:跳过 -->`). Deployed projects should rerun `/story-setup` and start a new session.
>
> Starting in v0.6.22: long-form prose gains per-genre "prose prompt cards" — 32 番茄-genre voice cards recalled into the writer at draft time (card text never leaks into prose), plus outline-boundary and per-chapter formula gates against padding; short-form adds a submission layer `submission-craft` (Zhihu Yanxuan / mini-program / Fanqie platform tones, lead-in polish, paywall breakpoint design); suite-wide skill docs deduplicated by ~33KB; story-setup adds generic Web AI deployment. Deployed projects should rerun `/story-setup` and start a new session.
>
> Starting in v0.6.24-fork: second-round methodology validation against real hit-story corpora (via the TikHub Zhihu API) — the `story-short-write` execution rule "one reversal per story" is rewritten as "one spine-level reversal, high-frequency minor flips as pacing fuel" (disambiguation), and the 悬疑脑洞型 pack gains a five-step rule-horror authoring method plus the true-rules doctrine.
>
> Starting in v0.6.23-fork: `story-short-write` adds two genre-style packs — `现实共鸣型` (family-of-origin exploitation / workplace gaslighting counterattack / bride-price traps) and `悬疑脑洞型` (death games / rule-horror), growing the core genre set from 4 to 6. Both packs disclose their source evidence and confidence level, and explicitly distinguish their emotional register (clear-eyed retaliation / cold deductive dread) from the sob-and-scorch-earth tone of the 追妻火葬场 pack.
>
> Starting in v0.6.22-fork: `story-long-write` Phase 5 adds a `check-typos.js` typo checker as the first check right after a chapter is written and saved (ahead of the AI-tone/degeneration/punctuation scripts), covering a curated dictionary of high-confidence common Chinese typos; every hit is advisory and the script never rewrites the file. `质检进度.md` template gains a matching column.
> Starting in v0.6.21: short-form writing reference cleanup — `story-short-write` drops stale long-form inherited references and now uses `short-format` / `short-craft` / `short-deslop` plus four genre packs (wife-chasing crematorium, revenge face-slap, CEO/wealthy family, domestic/palace intrigue) for short-story format, direct emotion, pacing density, and AI-tone cleanup; existing deployed projects should rerun `/story-setup` and start a new session to pick up the updated narrative-writer short-story exception.
>

## Installation

**Option 1** Tell Claude Code / OpenCode / ZCode / OpenClaw / Codex, or another Web AI / agent platform that can import a skill archive:

```
Install this skill https://github.com/lsl317603815-stack/oh-story-claudecode/releases/latest/download/oh-story-release.zip
```

**Option 2** Command line:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/lsl317603815-stack/oh-story-claudecode/releases/latest/download/oh-story-release.zip -y -g
```

`-g` installs globally (available in every directory); drop `-g` to install only into the current directory. Re-run the same command to update. This URL always resolves to the stable asset from the latest formal GitHub Release, so it never installs the moving `main` development state.

> After updating, if a project has already run `/story-setup`, re-run `/story-setup` from the project root to sync hooks / agents / references. Per-version changes are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [Releases](https://github.com/lsl317603815-stack/oh-story-claudecode/releases); the release process is in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
>

> **Codex developers (dev-only):** Use the repository in-place only when developing this repository or testing unreleased `main`: Codex scans `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills` (a symlink to `skills/`) and discovers all 16 skills; invoke via `$story`, `$story-setup`, or `/skills`. This is not a stable installation/update path. On Windows, enable git `core.symlinks=true` or use the Release archive above.
> After `$story-setup` deploys into a writing project, it creates `.codex/agents/*.toml`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.codex/hooks/{story_codex_hook.py,run-story-hook.sh,run-story-hook.cmd}`, and `.codex/skills/story-setup/references/agent-references/`. Trust the project `.codex/` layer, review/trust hooks in `/hooks`, and open a fresh Codex session so custom agents load.
>
> **ZCode users:** Install the stable Release archive above. Adding the moving repository as a Plugin Management marketplace is for development testing only (dev-only). Once installed, invoke the 16 Skills/Commands through `$story`, `$story-setup`, or the `/` panel. With `target_cli=zcode`, `$story-setup` deploys `.zcode/skills/`, `.zcode/commands/`, and `.zcode/hooks/story_zcode_hook.js`, then safely merges `.zcode/config.json` and the root `AGENTS.md`. Hooks require `node` on PATH. ZCode 3.3.4 does not execute project/plugin custom agents and has no `PreCompact` or `SessionEnd`; affected workflows report a solo/direct fallback, while `SessionStart` restores context after compaction.
>
> **OpenCode users:** After global install, opencode auto-discovers skills from `~/.claude/skills/`; trigger story-setup with natural language on first use (e.g., "use story-setup to deploy the web novel environment"), then **exit and re-enter with `opencode -c`** for slash commands to work. Some hook behaviors differ from Claude Code (session-start / session-end / compact, etc.) — see the OpenCode section in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
>
> **OpenClaw users:** Current support is skills-only. OpenClaw can discover the 14 story skills from workspace `skills/`, `.agents/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.openclaw/skills`, or configured extra skill roots. `SKILL.md` files use OpenClaw-compatible single-line `name` / `description` plus single-line JSON `metadata.openclaw`. When `story-setup` targets OpenClaw, it copies the skills into project `skills/` and writes an OpenClaw `AGENTS.md`; agents/hooks are intentionally deferred, so outline-before-prose guards are soft skill checks rather than runtime enforcement. If new skills do not appear immediately, open a fresh OpenClaw session or wait for the skills watcher to refresh.
>
> **Reasonix users:** Current support is Skills + a native plugin manifest (Phase 1). Reasonix natively scans `.agents/skills` (a symlink to `skills/`) and discovers all 16 skills — verify with `reasonix doctor capabilities`; you can also `reasonix plugin install` via the root `reasonix-plugin.json`. Project-level `story-setup` deployment and hooks are later phases. If Windows symlinks are disabled, use the native plugin instead.
>
> **Generic Web AI / agent users:** Download and extract the Release asset above, then have the agent read its `skills/*/SKILL.md` plus the relevant `references/`. Reading the moving GitHub repository directly is dev-only testing. For local project copies, run `story-setup` with `target_cli=generic`; it only writes a generic `AGENTS.md` and `skills/`. Without this project's hooks/custom agents, checks run as skill-level soft constraints or solo/direct fallbacks.

> **Multi-agent collaboration needs setup + a fresh session**: the 7 specialist agents (story-architect, narrative-writer, consistency-checker, etc.) are written into your project's `.claude/agents/` by `/story-setup`, or into `.codex/agents/*.toml` by `$story-setup`. Claude Code and Codex register custom agents most reliably at session start; ZCode 3.3.4, OpenClaw Phase 1, Reasonix Phase 1, and the generic path default to skills + solo fallback. To check Claude/Codex agents: run `/story-review` in the new session — `Effective Mode: full/lean` means agents registered, `Fallback: ... -> solo` means they are unavailable.

## Local Writing Dashboard

Run `/story dashboard` (use `$story dashboard` in Codex) from a project root to start a local-only workspace on `127.0.0.1`. It browses deconstruction libraries and writing projects, searches files, and safely edits allow-listed text formats with version-checked saves and confirmed deletion.

Dashboard tests generate neutral fixtures at runtime; they do not copy, display, or depend on any third-party novel demo.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | Description |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| `story-setup` | `/story-setup` / `$story-setup` | Environment setup — Claude/OpenCode/Codex/ZCode/OpenClaw plus generic (safe merge) |
| `story` | `/story` / `$story` | Toolbox router — routes intents and launches the local Dashboard |
| `story-long-write` | `/story-long-write` | Long-form writing — outline building, character design, prose output |
| `story-long-analyze` | `/story-long-analyze` | Long-form deconstruction — Golden First 3 Chapters, payoff design, pacing analysis |
| `story-long-scan` | `/story-long-scan` | Long-form trend scan — Qidian/Fanqie/Jinjiang market trends |
| `story-short-write` | `/story-short-write` | Short-form writing — emotion design, twist crafting, polish & delivery |
| `story-short-analyze` | `/story-short-analyze` | Short-form deconstruction — story core, structure, emotional arc, reversal design, writing techniques, resonance analysis |
| `story-short-scan` | `/story-short-scan` | Short-form trend scan — Zhihu Yanayan/Fanqie short-form trending data |
| `story-deslop` | `/story-deslop` | De-AI-ify — detect and remove AI writing traces |
| `story-import` | `/story-import` | Reverse import — parse existing novels into standard project structure |
| `story-review` | `/story-review` | Multi-perspective review — 4-agent adversarial review + Fanqie/Qidian/Zhihu scoring rubrics |
| `story-grill` | `/story-grill` `/采访` | Interview-style finalization — settings/volume/chapter outlines decided item by item with resumable decision ledgers |
| `story-drama-write` | `/story-drama-write` `/写剧本` | Short-drama screenplays — go straight to script (16:9 or 9:16) without writing a novel; project setup and episode outlines are decided item by item |
| `story-cover` | `/story-cover` | Cover generation — title & genre analysis + GPT-Image-2 image generation |
| `browser-cdp` | `/browser-cdp` | Browser control — CDP protocol for scraping with reusable login sessions |

> `story-deslop` uses local prose linting: blocking applies only to deterministic style/punctuation issues, while other findings require read-through judgment; external detectors such as Zhuque are self-check references, not replacements for human review.

Natural language also triggers: `帮我开书` ("help me start writing") → `story-long-write`, `这篇太AI了` ("this is too AI-ish") → `story-deslop`, `把我的书导进来` ("import my book") → `story-import`, `林晚现在什么状态` ("what's Shen Zhi's current status") → `story-explorer`.

## Agent System

Writing skills internally coordinate 7 specialized agents:

| Agent | Model | Role |
|:------|:------|:-----|
| **story-architect** | Opus | Story architecture — genre positioning, outline structure, hook/twist design, emotion arcs |
| **character-designer** | Sonnet | Character design — profiles, voice, motivation chains, dialogue writing |
| **narrative-writer** | Sonnet | Narrative writer — prose writing, de-AI-ify, format compliance |
| **consistency-checker** | Haiku | Consistency check — fact conflict scanning, foreshadowing tracking, S1-S4 grading reports |
| **story-researcher** | Sonnet | Research — CDP search + full-text extraction, multi-source cross-verification, structured reference files |
| **story-explorer** | Haiku | Story query — read-only character/foreshadowing/setting/progress lookup, quick context loading |
| **chapter-extractor** | Haiku | Chapter extraction — summaries, plot points, character mentions, parallel deconstruction unit |

Agents load writing theory from `references/` on demand (character design, dialogue techniques, twist toolbox, etc. — 100+ methodology files), without reserving context window space.

## Automation Hooks

For Claude Code projects, `/story-setup` deploys the following 8 shell hooks. Other adapters reuse the same guard logic through the events their runtimes support:

| Hook | Trigger | Function |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| session-start.sh | Session start | Display branch, progress snapshot, deconstruction status |
| session-end.sh | Session end | Log session to `追踪/session-log.txt` |
| detect-story-gaps.sh | Session start | Detect setting gaps, missing outlines, foreshadowing breaks |
| pre-compact.sh | Before context compaction | Save progress snapshot path and line-count summary |
| post-compact.sh | After context compaction | Prompt to read progress snapshot for context recovery |
| validate-story-commit.sh | git commit | Check hardcoded attributes, setting required fields (warning only, non-blocking) |
| guard-outline-before-prose.sh | Before writing prose (Write/Edit) | Blocks first creation of a chapter/story body when its 细纲/小节大纲 is missing (blocking) — enforces outline-first |
| check-prose-after-write.sh | After prose is written (PostToolUse: Write/Edit/MultiEdit) | Deterministic backstop scan for toxic AI phrasings / truncation / AI self-reference (advisory, non-blocking) — this is the v0.7.0 "toxic-phrase debt gate" mechanism |

## Project File Structure

A long-form novel can easily reach hundreds of thousands of words across hundreds of chapters. Setting conflicts, broken foreshadowing, timeline inconsistencies — relying on memory alone is a recipe for disaster.

The file system separates settings, outlines, prose, and tracking into independent dimensions. The conversation handles creation; the file system handles memory.

**Long-form:**

```

├── Settings/
│   ├── World/              # Background, power systems, etc. — one file per topic

**Short-form file structure:**

```
短篇/{Title}/
├── 正文.md                  # Final draft
├── 小节大纲.md              # 8-section structure + emotion curve

    └── {Book}/
        ├── 拆文报告.md
        ├── 情节节点.md
        └── 写作手法.md
```

**Deconstruction Library:** Deconstruction skills save structured outputs (characters, plotlines, settings, chapters) under `拆文库/{Book Title}/` at project root; long-form plot output includes `节奏.md` and `情绪模块.md`. Writing skills consume these assets through `对标/{书名}/剧情/` and related benchmark subdirectories, or automatically fall back to reading from the deconstruction library.

**`.active-book`:** a text file at project root containing the active book's relative path (for example, `长篇/My Novel`). Hooks and writing skills use it to locate the current project.

## Knowledge Base

Each skill includes a `references/` knowledge base loaded on demand to keep context lean.
